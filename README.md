Project Concept We have developed an indoor air quality meter that can sample air quality in an indoor setting, the device fitted with an assortment of sensors that read air indices of several air compositions e.g Temperature, Carbon Monoxide, Smoke, Particulate matter (PM 2.5), LPG and send them to the cloud via Sigfox wireless technology. This data is then pushed onto the Azure cloud service where analysis is done and the Air Quality Index calculated from this data. The data is then pushed to a mobile app that can be used to track the air quality data in a visualized easy to read context. A separate dashboard was also build where batch sensor data from a specific area are presented graphically for stake holders like the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) can view and analyze the data for informed policy making and strategy formation for environmental action in specific areas. The device is environmentally friendly and easy to use in all sorts of indoor settings e.g Offices and Households. It has also been incorporated with a machine learning model that can predict air quality information over stipulated periods of time from 1 min to 5 years with reference to the WHO data sets on air quality as our training data sets. This can enable users to get notifications on impending hazardous conditions that might be lethal to individuals with Asthma or Allergies.
